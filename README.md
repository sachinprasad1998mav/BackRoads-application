# Travel Website Project

Welcome to the repository for my travel website project. This project showcases a travel website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. It consists of two main parts: the initial HTML/CSS/JS version and the final version built using React.

## Project Structure

- `backroads-html`: This directory contains the initial version of the website implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes the assets needed for the project.

- `final`: This directory contains the final version of the project, which is a React application. To set up and run the React app, follow these steps:

  1. Navigate to the `final` folder.
  2. Run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
  3. Once the dependencies are installed, run `npm start` to start the development server.

## How to Run the React App

To run the React app, follow these steps:

1. Install project dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Components

The React version of the project is organized into components for better code management. Here's an overview of the components:

- `Navbar`: Navigation bar component.
- `Hero`: Hero section component.
- `About`: About section component.
- `Services`: Services section component.
- `Tours`: Tours section component.
- `Footer`: Footer component.

Each component is responsible for rendering a specific section of the website.
